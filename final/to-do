Add requesting-user-name to send-document requests and create-job requests.

rfc3995

#- The extra EXPECT lines you copied from the get-printer-attributes.test file are unnecessary and can be removed.
#- Please check for the Create-Job-Subscriptions operation and use DEFINE-MATCH so you can test that optional operation.
#- The 'none' value is required in notify-events-supported (not listed)
#- Should check the value of 'notify-user-data' in the Get-Subscription-Attributes test.
#- WRT the notify-charset tests, section 5.3.6 of RFC 3995 says that a printer can substitute the attributes-charset value if the requested charset is not supported. But it *is* a bug if we are not returning the attribute in get-subcription-attributes.
#- WRT notify-time-interval, should do "EXPECT !notify-time-interval" since that attribute should not be present.
#- The Print-URI operation test needs to be conditional - Print-URI is an optional operation, so check at the beginning in operations-supported and DEFINE-MATCH HAVE_PRINT_URI...
#- The Create-Job operation test needs to be conditional - Create-Job is an optional operation...
#- After the Cancel-Subscription test, maybe try doing a get-notifications request for the canceled subscription to verify it has been canceled (should get status client-error-not-found).
#- Add ISSUE in comments for bugs.

"rfc3996.2.test":

#- The extra EXPECT lines you copied from the get-printer-attributes.test file are unnecessary and can be removed.
#- You can just test for the RFC 3996 operation and attributes here.
#- Add ISSUE in comments for bugs.



INTERESTING FACTS (MAY ACCOUNT FOR BUGS):

#Test file naming convention should be:
Base tests: "pwg5100.N.test" or "rfcNNNN.test"
Individual tests: "pwg5100.N-test-name.test" or "rfcNNNN-test-name.test"
